jquery-plugin-template
======================

This is a basic template for jquery plugins. It contains nothing but the structure and helpful comments. It should be a good start to build your own plugin.


Upcoming
--------
- Use a global config object to setup defaults. This will obviate modifications in the source, so later updates will be more easy
- Implement i18n with examples
